###Developing
You will have to configure your local osx apache2 server to statically serve the directory with the code. Beyond that, follow these steps to get set up:

  1. fork the repo and clone your fork to your machine
  2. cd into the directory with the app
  3. ```npm install```
  4. ```grunt && grunt watch```
  5. open index.html in your browser

###Developing

Follow these steps to get set up:

  1. fork the repo and clone your fork to your machine
  2. cd into the directory with the app
  3. ```npm install```
  4. ```grunt && grunt watch```
  5. open index.html in your browser

You will have to run the `dist` folder as a local server. The easiest way to do that is going to the dist folder (`cd dist`) and then running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. 

Go to http://localhost:8000
